# Alien-Invasion-Game
Created a 2D shooting game in Processing.org inspired by “Chicken Invaders” featuring a bottom bar controlled by keyboard and mouse for shooting aliens.
The app has the following features:
- Gameplay mechanics including alien movement in a sinusoidal pattern, bomb-dropping with health impact (visualized via color changes on shields and the bar).
- Implemented interactive elements such as randomly appearing shields that absorb bombs and change color when hit.

*** Important ***
This is self initiated project, created in Processing.org. The reason why I made this project was to familiarize myself with how Processing.org works, preparing for the module "Programming Project" that takes place in first year Computer Science Degree in Trinity College Dublin. This project took me 2 weeks (including research on how to make certain things work).
